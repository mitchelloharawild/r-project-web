<li>USA: The R Foundation is not registered as a charitable organisation in the USA. We are looking at becoming registered as a foreign 501(c)3 non-profit organisation. This would still not make personal donations to R Foundation tax-deductible, but would make it easier for US non-profit organisations to donate.</li>
