<p>The R Foundation is a not for profit organization working in the public interest. It has been founded by the members of the R Development Core Team in order to</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide support for the R project and other innovations in statistical computing. We believe that R has become a mature and valuable tool and we would like to ensure its continued development and the development of future innovations in software for statistical and computational research.</li>
<li>Provide a reference point for individuals, instititutions or commercial enterprises that want to support or interact with the R development community.</li>
<li>Hold and administer the copyright of R software and documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>R is an official part of the <a href="http://www.fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</a>'s GNU project, and the R Foundation has similar goals to other open source software foundations like the <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation">Apache Foundation</a> or the <a href="http://foundation.gnome.org">GNOME Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>Among the goals of the R Foundation are the support of continued development of R, the exploration of new methodology, teaching and training of statistical computing and the organization of meetings and conferences with a statistical computing orientation. We hope to attract sufficient funding to make these goals realities.</p>
<p>The <strong>R Foundation Statutes</strong> can be downloaded as PDF file in <a href="Rfoundation-statutes.pdf">English</a> or <a href="Rfoundation-statutes-at.pdf">German</a>.</p>
