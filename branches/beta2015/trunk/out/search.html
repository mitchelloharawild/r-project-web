<h1 id="search">Search</h1>
<p>For hardware reasons (disk space, CPU performance) there is currently no search facility at the R master webserver itself. However, due to the very active R user community (without which R would not be what it is today) there are other possibilities to search in R web pages and mail archives:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <a href="http://finzi.psych.upenn.edu/search.html">R site search</a> is provided by Jonathan Baron at the University of Pennsylvania, United States. This engine lets you search help files, manuals, and mailing list archives.</li>
<li><a href="http://dir.gmane.org/index.php?prefix=gmane.comp.lang.r.">Gmane's R-lists</a> mirrors several of our lists, with web, news, and RSS interfaces and search facilities.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rseek.org">Rseek</a> is provided by Sasha Goodman at Stanford university. This engine lets you search several R-related sites and can easily be added to the toolbar of popular browsers.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/">Nabble R Forum</a> is an innovative search engine for R messages. As it has been misused for spam injection, it is nowadays severely filtered. In addition, its gateway to R-help is sometimes not bidirectional, so we do <strong>not</strong> recommend it for posting (rather at most for browsing).</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to all of them!</p>
<p>In addition, you can always use the advanced search feature of the <a href="http://www.google.com/advanced_search">Google search engine</a>:</p>
