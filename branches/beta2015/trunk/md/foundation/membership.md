## R Foundation Membership

**Ordinary members**

are elected by a majority vote of the general assembly. New ordinary members are selected based on their non-monetary contributions (code, effort, ...) to the R project. The initial set of ordinary members at establishment of the organization consisted of the members of the "R Development Core Team" as listed in the sources of R release 1.5.0.

**Supporting Members**
